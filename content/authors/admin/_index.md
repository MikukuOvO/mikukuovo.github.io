## Currently an undergraduate student at Wuhan University.
I'm currently working on several projects involving missing feature completion, ranging from completion using graph neural networks to generalized completion relying solely on patterns among data with unsupervised representation learning methods.
My research interests include:

- Unsupervised Representation Learning
- Data Mining
