## I am currently an undergraduate student at Wuhan University. 

In July-August 2024, I will go to University of California, Davis to participate in Professor Yubei Chen's research group to conduct **Unsupervised Learning** and **World Model** research. I hope to have an internship in a company related to my research interests after the summer research.

My research interests include:

- **Graph Neural Networks**
- **Self-supervised Learning**
